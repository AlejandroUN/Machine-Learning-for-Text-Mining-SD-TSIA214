      " If you ever wanted to look like \"one of the most dangerous inmates in prison\n",
      " history\", as one judge described Charles Bronson, now’s your chance. Bronson -\n",
      " the serial hostage taker, not the movie star - has written a health and\n",
      " fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary\n",
      " muscle power. \n",
      " \n",
      " Solitary Fitness - a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson, 48,\n",
      " has spent 24 of his 28 prison years in solitary confinement - explains how he\n",
      " has turned himself into a lean, mean, fitness machine while living 23 hours a\n",
      " day in a space just 12 feet by eight feet, on a diet of scrubs grub and at\n",
      " virtually no cost. \n",
      " \n",
      " The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a\n",
      " fortune on gym memberships, protein supplements or designer trainers, and\n",
      " starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the\n",
      " exercise industry. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"I pick up a fitness mag, I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it,\" is the\n",
      " opening paragraph penned by Bronson. \"It’s a joke and a big con and they call\n",
      " me a criminal!\" You can’t help feeling he has a point. \n",
      " \n",
      " This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars, having\n",
      " already published Birdman Opens His Mind, which features drawings and poems\n",
      " created by Bronson while in prison. And he is not the first prisoner to\n",
      " discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty’s pleasure. \n",
      " \n",
      " Jimmy Boyle, the Scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents\n",
      " when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison’s famous special unit, which aimed to\n",
      " help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to\n",
      " express their emotions artistically. Boyle was sentenced to life for the\n",
      " murder of \"Babs\" Rooney in 1967. Once released, he moved to Edinburgh where he\n",
      " has become a respected artist. His first novel, Hero of the Underworld, was\n",
      " published in 1999 and his autobiography, A Sense of Freedom, was made into an\n",
      " award-winning film. \n",
      " \n",
      " Hugh Collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of William Mooney in\n",
      " Glasgow, and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison\n",
      " officers, earning him an extra seven-year sentence. But, after being\n",
      " transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and\n",
      " developed an interest in art. He later published Autobiography of a Murderer,\n",
      " a frank account of Glasgow’s criminal culture in the 1960s, which received\n",
      " critical praise. \n",
      " \n",
      " And Lord Archer doesn’t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books\n",
      " that have made him millions while in jail. He recently signed a three-book\n",
      " deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported £10 million, and is no doubt\n",
      " scribbling away as we speak. \n",
      " \n",
      " So why is it that men like Collins, Bronson and Boyle, who can be so\n",
      " destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck\n",
      " on the inside? Steve Richards, Bronson’s publisher, has published many books\n",
      " about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both\n",
      " pragmatic and profound. \n",
      " \n",
      " He says: \"Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have\n",
      " known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the\n",
      " chance to focus on their creative skills. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an\n",
      " education, if their early years have been hard. It could be the first time\n",
      " anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " However, Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. He says:\n",
      " \"Once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine\n",
      " the very essence of who they are. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"They ask themselves, am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence? Or\n",
      " am I a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something\n",
      " good?\" \n",
      " \n",
      " Bronson - who was born Michael Gordon Peterson, but changed his name to that\n",
      " of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films - has, so far, been remembered\n",
      " mainly for things bad. He was originally jailed for seven years for armed\n",
      " robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term\n",
      " over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. In 2000 he was\n",
      " jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly\n",
      " two days during a jail siege. \n",
      " \n",
      " Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is\n",
      " renowned for his strength. He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands\n",
      " and does up to 3,000 - yes, 3,000 - press-ups a day. As he puts it: \"I can hit\n",
      " a man 20 times in four seconds, I can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, Solitary\n",
      " Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson’s face sitting on every\n",
      " coffee table in the land. He might be the man to give us the dream body which\n",
      " so many so-called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. Because\n",
      " Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. \n",
      " \n",
      " \"All this crap about high-protein drinks, pills, diets, it’s just a load of\n",
      " bollocks and a multi-million-pound racket,\" he writes, in what can only be\n",
      " described as a refreshingly honest style. \"We can all be fat lazy bastards,\n",
      " it’s our choice, I’m sick of hearing and reading about excuses, if you stuff\n",
      " your face with shit you become shit, that’s logical to me.\" \n",
      " \n",
      " As motivational mantras go, that might be just the kick up the, er, backside\n",
      " we all needed. \n",
      " \n",
